          <p>
            I'm a highly motivated, hard-working Student at University of
            Birmingham studying Coding and Web development looking for a new
            opportunity to develop my skills both professionally and personally.
            I pride myself on being a proficient, approachable and reliable
            individual, with a high drive to learn and willingness to go the
            extra mile to exceed my client's expectations.
